# Udacity React Nanodegree Project â€” Readable Client App
This is my assessment submission for the Redux segment of Udacity's React Nanodegree. It is the client for a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.
