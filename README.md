# Readable

This is my project for the Redux segment of Udacity's React Nanodegree. I built the client for a content and comment web app. Users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are able to edit and delete posts, and comments.

## Start Developing

To get started developing right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install` or `yarn`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, start the front-end server
    - `cd client`
    - `npm install` or `yarn`
    - `npm start` or `yarn start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
